# India Education Budget Analysis (Power BI)



## Overview
This project analyzes India's education budget over time to understand absolute spending growth, internal allocation between departments, and education’s relative priority within the total Union Budget.



## Key Insights
- How has the education budget grown over time?
Education spending shows a general upward trend in nominal terms over the long run, although short-term stagnation and declines are observed during the mid-2010s due to budgetary restructuring and fiscal rebalancing, before growth resumes.



- How is education spending distributed between school and higher education?
School education consistently receives a larger portion of the education budget compared to higher education. Although allocations to both areas have grown over time, the gap between them remains significant, indicating sustained emphasis on school-level education.



- Has education’s share in the Union Budget increased or declined?
Education’s share in the Union Budget has declined since the early 2010s, decreasing from around 5% to approximately 2% in recent years. This suggests that while education spending increased in absolute terms, it did not keep pace with the growth of overall government expenditure.
